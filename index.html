        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="text" id="intro">
        <p>During my computer science education, I learned skills across a variety of technical fields. I learned numerous programming languages, including C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, and more. Early on, I gained experience with object-oriented programming, algorithms and data structures, web design, and databases. Later on in my degree, I gained experience with client-server development, mobile application development, security, testing, and graphics programming. I also learned some more general concepts, such as collaboration and communication within software development, technical writing, and the software development life cycle.</p>
        <p>Some notable projects throughout my college degree include an event reminder Android application (Java), a maze pathfinding AI program (Python), a full-stack website (mostly JavaScript), and a GUI calculator desktop application (C#).</p>
        <p>As I approached the end of my degree, I began to specialize in game development. I enrolled in two game development electives. In both of them, I learned to use the Unreal Engine to design and develop games. I created an arena shooter in which one player competes against multiple AI-controlled players, and a 3D platformer game. </p>
        <p>A part of my computer science “Capstone” course, the final course in the program, I was tasked with enhancing a project from any previous CS course. I chose to improve a project from a course called Computational Graphics. The project was an animated beach scene including moving waves and a day / night cycle. It was originally just a graphics application with no interactivity or objective. As part of my series of enhancements, I turned it into a game. I added gravity, collision, walking, running, jumping, swimming, and the ability to use a game controller (in addition to a mouse and keyboard). I also added ten collectible items, scattered throughout the small open world, resembling beach balls. The objective is to find and collect all of the beach balls, most of which are located in hard-to-reach places. </p>
        <p>Below is a video code review detailing the original application, code, and planned enhancements:</p>
